# AutoJudge – Programming Problem Difficulty Predictor

**Author:** Shubhi Gupta  
**Project Type:** Machine Learning + NLP  
**Interface:** Streamlit Web Application  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
AutoJudge is an intelligent system that predicts the difficulty of programming problems using only their textual descriptions.  
The system performs two tasks:

- **Classification:** Easy / Medium / Hard  
- **Regression:** Numerical difficulty score  

The goal is to automate difficulty estimation similar to competitive programming platforms.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used
The dataset consists of programming problems collected from competitive programming platforms.

Each problem contains:
- Title
- Problem description
- Input description
- Output description
- Sample input/output
- Difficulty class (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Difficulty score (numeric)

The dataset is provided in **JSONL format**, where each line represents one problem.

---

## 🛠️ Approach and Models Used

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing
- Combined all text fields (title, description, input, output, sample I/O) into a single text feature
- Handled missing values safely
- Converted sample I/O lists into plain text

---

### 🔹 Feature Extraction
- Used **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Unigrams and bigrams
- Maximum 3000 features
- English stopword removal

---

### 🔹 Classification Model
- **Logistic Regression**
- Predicts problem difficulty class (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Class imbalance handled using `class_weight="balanced"`

---

### 🔹 Regression Model
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- Predicts numerical difficulty score
- Chosen for robustness and ability to model non-linear patterns

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

### Classification
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  

Approximate Accuracy: **~45–47%**

### Regression
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Approximate MAE: **~1.7–2.0**

## ▶️ Steps to Run the Project Locally

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2️⃣ Train the models
``` bash
python data.py
```
(data1.py and data2.py are using different models to compare performances)
### 3️⃣ Run the web application
``` bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```
---
## 🌐 Web Interface Explanation

The project includes a simple and interactive **Streamlit web interface** to demonstrate the working of the trained models.

### Interface Components:
- **Text Area:**  
  Allows the user to paste a full programming problem description, similar to problems found on competitive programming platforms.

- **Predict Difficulty Button:**  
  Triggers the prediction process using the pre-trained models.

### Output Display:
Once the user clicks the predict button, the interface displays:
- **Predicted Difficulty Class:**  
  One of *Easy*, *Medium*, or *Hard*, generated by the classification model.
- **Predicted Difficulty Score:**  
  A numerical score representing the estimated difficulty level, generated by the regression model and normalized for better interpretability.

### Working Logic:
- The input text is converted into numerical features using the same **TF-IDF vectorizer** used during training.
- The classification model predicts the difficulty category.
- The regression model predicts the difficulty score.
- No retraining occurs during runtime; all predictions are performed using saved trained models.

The web interface allows users to easily test and visualize model predictions without interacting directly with the code.
